How to confirm Memory Leak?
1- Monitor Java Heap memory usage
2- If full GC are not able to reclaim Old Gen memory then it could be memory issue
	- Heap size might be small
3- Increase the heap and monitor the GC performance and test application
4- In case there is no change, there might be potential memory leak.

JConsole to monitor heap usage - live application
Collect GC Log and analize GC logs if live monitoring not possible.

Heap diagonistic
- GC logs (heap requiments/excesive GCs/Long Pauses) - Java -XX* parameters
- Heap dump
- Heap Histograms
